(defn decorate
  "Main interface to stillsuit. Accepts a map containing various parameters as input; returns
  a map with an app context and a schema. The map can be passed to [[execute]] in order to
  invoke lacinia with its configuration.

  The single argument to `(decorate)` should be a map with the following keys:

  - `:stillsuit/schema`: a normal
    [lacinia schema definition](http://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/init-schema.html#schema-edn-file).
  - `:stillsuit/connection`: a datomic [connection object]().
  - `:stillsuit/resolvers`: a map of keywords to resolver function objects, identical to the
    map you'd pass to
    [`(lacinia.util/attach-resolvers)`](http://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resolve/attach.html).
  - `:stillsuit/config` (optional): a map of
    [configuration options](http://docs.workframe.com/stillsuit/current/manual/#_compiling_a_schema)
    for stillsuit.
  - `:stillsuit/context` (optional): a map containing any custom information your resolvers need,
    identical to the `context` argument you'd pass to `(lacinia/execute)`.
  - `:stillsuit/transformers` (optional): a map of keywords to scalar transformer function objects,
    identical to the map you'd pass to
    [`(lacinia.util/attach-scalar-transformers)`](http://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom-scalars.html#attaching-scalar-transformers).
  - `:stillsuit/entity-filters` (optional): a map of keywords to entity filter functions, which are
    used to filter the results of :stillsuit/ref resolvers.

  The return value of this function is a map with two keys:

  - `:stillsuit/schema`: the compiled, transformed schema definition
  - `:stillsuit/app-context`: an application context object

  These two data structures can be passed to `(lacinia/execute)` directly, or there is a
  simple wrapper function [[execute]] that will invoke lacinia for you.
